# Abstract

The E-Library Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML and CSS for the frontend, PHP for backend logic, and MySQL for database management. It provides a centralized platform for managing library operations, including book management, user registration, and issue/return tracking. The system includes dedicated interfaces for admin and student users, with functionalities tailored to their roles. The admin can manage book inventories, monitor user activities, and handle registrations, while students can search for books, request books, and view borrowing history. This digital system aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility in library operations.
